# Josh & Nicole's Europe Trip

December 3rd to 11th

## Saturday, December 3
I flew from Heathrow to the Nice, France airport, where Nicole and I met me in the airport terminal. When I walked out into the airport lobby where she was waiting, I saw her sitting on a bench. We met eyes, she smiled, and stood to walk toward me. I couldn’t believe how beautiful she was! Even more beautiful than she looks in photos and over FaceTime. We hugged, and I couldn’t resist kissing her right away. Her lips were incredible...and she’s a fantastic kisser. Our first was *perfect*.

We went to the rental car area to get our Avis rental. When we went outside to get the car, the employee who was helping us bumped her head really badly on a metal beam, started to cry, and asked for a tissue (which we didn’t have). Nicole and I felt so awkward. The rental car they gave us was a black, four-door Opel Corsa with manual transmission. It was so much fun to drive. The first place we drove was to Nicole’s apartment so that I could drop off my luggage. We then drove to Cannes. We walked along the main road and visited a Christmas market. There was also some type of carnival going on where they had small attractions. One of them was Indiana-Jones-themed but the sign said “Indiana J.” Then we walked through the lobby of the InterContinental Carlton Cannes Hotel (which made Nicole feel super awkward). We walked up the hill to the glowing Cannes sign and saw the exterior of the cathedral next to it (Notre Dame de l'Espérance).

We drove back to Nicole’s apartment and made out in her bed. - We went back to Nicole’s apartment where we made out and and slept. Before falling asleep, I told Nicole that my kids woke me up a couple weeks before telling me that I was snoring really loudly...but I told Nicole that I didn’t actually snore and that that was a fluke. But in the middle of the night, I woke up and heard her rummaging around for something. I asked her why she was awake and at first she wouldn’t tell me. For some reason I thought it was because she was horny, and asked her if that was the reason. But it turned out it was really because she was looking for ear plugs because I was snoring *really* loudly.

## Sunday, December 4
We left in the morning headed toward Switzerland. During the first part of the drive while we were still in France, I was driving well over the speed limit and a speeding camera took our photo in a tunnel. Though, we never saw a ticket from it, thankfully. I’m hoping one doesn’t show up in the mail! Once we got to Italy, we briefly got lost near a toll booth. Driving through Italy was beautiful. Around ever bend in the highway there was a new set of rolling hills with a small Italian town surrounding a Catholic church. We stopped at a gas station to get a late lunch. It had a small deli of sorts where they had some pre-made sandwiches. Nicole ordered one with mozzarella and tomato. Mine had shredded pork. They were both incredible, we couldn't believe food that delicious could be found in a gas station, of all places.

Entering Switzerland was gorgeous. A big part of the drive was in and out of cement tunnels that had openings cut out of the side, allowing drivers to see the beautiful view of the snow-covered mountains. We stopped at a gas station and were surprised to learn that it’s normal there to pay *after* filling up your tank. In total, from Antibes, France to our destination (Täsch, Switzerland) the drive was about six hours. We had to park the car in a parking garage in Täsch since our final destiation (Zermatt) doesn't allow cars. But, while trying to find the parking garage, we briefly got a bit lost behind the small Täsch homes. After finding the parking garage we grabbed our bags and took the short train ride to Zermatt.

### Zermatt
Upon first arrival, we were surprised how prominent and solitary the Matterhorn appeared from Zermatt. We took photos of it while we walked to our hostel (The Matterhorn Hostel, which shares a building with a restaurant called Sparky’s). While we were checking in, a man who looked like Santa Claus showed up to stay in the hostel. I joked with Nicole later how I wanted to ask him if people tell him he looks like Santa. We went to our room to drop off our luggage. Then we waked around Zermatt looking for a place to eat dinner. We went into the lobby of the Zermatterhof Hotel (again, making Nicole feel uncomfortable) where they had a Matterhorn made out of chocolate in their lobby. We found a chocolate shop where we each got a tiny Matterhorn-shaped chocolate. Nicole got a milk chocolate one and mine was dark chocolate. We were pleasantly surprised to find a peanut butter cream inside the chocolates, kind of like a super fancy Reese’s eggs that we both love so much. We ultimately decided to go back to Sparky's for dinner. We were the only ones in the restaurant for the first little while, so we socialized with the owner (Sparky, a Brit). Nicole and I shared a delicious steak and ale pie and an order of garlic bread. By the time we were done, there were a few other customers, and the man we saw earlier who looked like Santa showed up—in a full Santa costume! He wanted to take photos and selfies with everyone, so Nicole and I got our photo taken with him. We laughed so hard when he would look surprised and say “ho ho ho” each time his picture was taken. After dinner we found a movie room in the basement of the hostel and watched part of *Pirates of the Caribbean* while I gave Nicole a shoulder massage. When we went to bed, Nicole and I laid in the bottom bunk of our hostel together for the first part of the night, but my snoring was out of control again and she moved to her own bunk. Later in the night, she came back to my bed because the heater was next to it, and she was freezing. We laid together again for a few minutes, then I went to the other bed for the rest of the night.

## Monday, December 5
### Zermatt
The next morning was *freezing*. We went to a pastry shop down the street from our hostel where we bought pastries with chocolate inside them. Then we walked toward the train station because we figured transportation up the mountain were over there. I got us lost for several minutes. Between the three major mountain excursions in the area, we decided to go up to the Rothorn peak since it offered the best view of the Matterhorn. To get to the peak, we rode an underground funicular, then gondola, then cable car. That was another reason we chose Rothorn—we knew we'd get to experience all three modes of transportation up the mountain. At each of the stops there were a lot of skiers, and Nicole mentioned how badly she wished she could ski there. At the very top of Rothorn there was a restaurant that was closed for the season. But helicopters kept showing up to drop off cargo. The wind the helicopters caused was crazy strong! The view of the Matterhorn was incomparable. I used an app on my phone called AR Mountains Map to identify all the different peaks we could see. There were also several posts a the peak describing some of the peaks in view, and each of those posts had a rock from the peak being described. Nicole and I sit on a boulder on the edge of the peak and took a selfie with the Matterhorn in the distance. I put my arm around her and felt like I was dreaming—it seemed unreal that I was looking at the *real* Matterhorn with a woman as beautiful, fun, and wonderful as Nicole.

After checking out of our hostel, on our way out of town we looked at the mountaineers’ tombstones surrounding Zermatt’s main Catholic cathedral, after which we took the train back to Täsch where we each got a slice of pizza with salami.

### Chillon Castle
We drove the two hours to Chillon Castle which is right on Lake Geneva. This was the only chance we were going to have to see Lake Geneva. I had planned to just stop and quickly see the exterior of the castle, but we decided to go inside—and we were really glad we did. It is a beautiful castle, and deceivingly big! We joked that the castle was like a clown car—it didn’t look all that big on the outside, but after about an hour of seeing rooms, we found there was more and more to see. It seemed to never end (which we weren’t complaining about). One of the rooms was called the Bernese Chamber, where we found a dark tunnel leading from it to the neighboring room. We stopped in the tunnel and kissed passionately. After seeing the neighboring room, we walked back through the tunnel so that we could kiss some more. In the basement of the castle they have around forty barrels where they age wine. Nicole and I fantasized about buying a bottle and saving it for far into the future when we would have a glass of it together.

<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/dkogtp843ra0d20/2016-12-05%2016.38.29-2.jpg?raw=0" />

When we first left Chillon Castle, Google Maps navigated us up the side of the mountain, driving through random Swiss neighborhoods. It was very beautiful, but when we came out of it it seemed to us that we could have taken a much faster route.

### Bern
We arrived in Bern that evening after the sun went down. We checked in at the Backpackers Hotel Glocke Hostel, which was very conveniently located—in the old part of town just around the corner from the Zytglogge (Bern’s clock tower). Since the hostel didn’t have parking, we had to park our car about 10 minutes away (by foot). We ate dinner at a restaurant called Lötschberg—Nicole had a plate of rösti, which is a traditional Swiss dish that is basically hash browns with various toppings, and I had a plate of sliced roast beef and Bernese fries. Nicole and I joked about the fact that the only thing that made the fries “Bernese” was that they kept the potato skin on, which is common in the states. Since we were already out, we walked around the city to see as many of the sights as time allowed. When we got back to our hostel, there were three other people in our room who had already fallen asleep. We tried putting the sheets on our beds as quietly as possible, but we kept laughing hysterically! It was so much fun, I felt like I was a kid again.

## Tuesday, December 6
### Bern
The next morning I got up early to move the car since our parking had expired. It took a few minutes of looking at the map to figure out which direction the car was in. While I was moving the car, Nicole witnessed two of our roommates (who were a couple) arguing because the guy lost his room key. His girlfriend kept saying things like, “I *never* lose *anything*.” We left the hostel to see the remaining sights we missed the night before. We stopped at the clock tower first so that we could see its performance (which begins four minutes before each hour). The part I wanted to see the most was when Father Time turns his hourglass upside down—but we waited for what felt like a really long time between the performance and when he finally turned his hourglass.

We were told the Bern Cathedral was open that morning, so we started walking in that direction. We stopped at a pastry cart for a quick breakfast. It was run by a man and his daughter. The man working there noticed we were American, and he asked us, “Who did you select?” I figured he was asking who we voted for in the recent election (which he was), and I said, “Neither!” He then said something about how he was glad we hadn’t voted for Trump. We bought two pastries—one had lemon and cherry filling, the other had a hazelnut spread. Nicole and I couldn’t stop talking about how delicious they were! By the time we got to the Bern Cathedral we realized it was closed for another couple hours. We took a few photos of the exterior before going to see the other sights we had missed. One of the things we saw was the Einstein House. It isn’t big—there are only a couple rooms. After seeing the rooms we watched part of a movie about Einstein’s life. After about 10 minutes of watching it, I turned to Nicole and said, “Should we go?” and she responded immediately with “Yes.” Apparently, both of us had been thinking about leaving for several minutes, but neither of us brought it up right away. We realized after a few days of being together that we think very much the same. We had most of the same ideas and thoughts, which we both love. We went back to the Bern Cathedral for our last sightseeing location before leaving Bern. Before going in, we bought a bratwurst from a stand out in front of the church. It was by far the best bratwurst we had ever had! We also drank a cup of hot apple cider. We went into the cathedral and spent some time in the main chapel area. The stained-glass windows were gorgeous. Nicole and I walked around the chapel separately for part of the time we were there. I would take a photo, then I’d turn to see where she was. After doing this several times, I took a photo of another stained-glass window and then turned to look for her, but I couldn’t see her at first. I had to walk around the chapel to find her, and when I finally saw her across the room, I finally felt like I could breathe again. It wasn’t that I was scared she had left, I was just so happy to see her. Looking at her makes me feel like a million bucks. We paid a few Swiss Francs to climb the 300+ steps to the top. The views were incredible, and it was a beautiful day. We kept stopping on the steps to touch and kiss each other. Just like with the Chillon Castle, the steps seemed to go on forever!

In the early afternoon we left Bern to make the short drive to Interlaken.

### Interlaken
When we arrived at the Backpackers Villa Sonnenhof Hostel in Interlaken, we laid in bed together for a little while, talking and kissing and laughing. Nicole jokingly told me to talk dirty to her. I said, "First I'd lay you down on your stomach...I MEAN BACK." We both burst into laughter.

After the sun went down we drove to Lake Thun (one of the two lakes between which Interlaken is situated) to take a quick look. We were only there for a few minutes since it was so cold and dark. For dinner, we ate at Restaurant Laterne, which was recommended to us by a lady at our hostel. Before ordering, I noticed that the menu had two different ways of spelling “rösti.” I was thinking either it was a spelling error or they were two different things. I asked the waitress about it (who was an old, grumpy Swiss lady), and she seemed pretty annoyed that I pointed it out. Nicole and I decided to share two entrees (which is basically what we did every time we ate dinner). One was raclette, another traditional Swiss food where they melt cheese on a plate and serve it with potatoes. The other was sausage with gravy. The raclette was definitely a lot better than the sausage. For dessert, we both really wanted some good Swiss chocolate, so we walked from our hostel to the small Interlaken city center. But the only chocolate shop we could find was closed (at 7pm). We ended up buying some Toblerone and took it back to our hostel. We went to our room and found all our Asian roommates there with their huge suitcases open on the floor. I noticed one of them had a bag that said something like, “Lindt chocolate factory tour.” I asked the guy about it because I was interested in learning more about the tour, in case it was something Nicole and I wanted to do. But he looked at me like I was crazy and he didn’t respond. We then grabbed a blanket from our beds and went to the movie room (which we had all to ourselves). We ate the chocolate we bought while watching a movie called “The Intern.” We both had very low expectations, so we ended up really liking it. Then Nicole wanted to show me some videos of a stand-up comedian named Tom Segura. We laughed hysterically! Then we shared a few of our favorite YouTube videos with each other. At the end of the night, we went back to our room and went to bed. I was on the bottom bunk and Nicole was on the top. We texted each other until we fell asleep.

## Wednesday, December 7
### Berner Oberland
We talked to the lady at our hostel the night before and she recommended a specific route for seeing the Alps in the region. We drove up to Lauterbrunnen, took a cable car up to Grütschalp, walked across to Mürren (where we stopped at a small shop for post cards), walked down to Gimmelwald, took a shuttle bus back up to Mürren, took the cable car down to Stechelberg, and took a bus back to where we parked our car in Lauterbrunnen. During our walk, the weather was clear and the sun was shining. The views were incredible, especially during our walk from Grütschalp to Mürren.

<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/r03k0i9q9oj1260/2016-12-07%2011.51.02-2.jpg?raw=0" />

In Gimmelwald we saw a cat and Nicole instantly said, “Kitty!” in her cute baby voice. We also found a small playground that had a long metal slide, which both Nicole and I slid down. We arrived at the cable car station in Gimmelwald with the intent of riding the cable car down to  Stechelberg—then we were planning on walking from there to Lauterbrunnen. After about a half hour of waiting at the Gimmelwald station, we figured the cable cars weren’t running. Luckily, a shuttle bus came by, which we rode back to Mürren, then we took the cable car down to Stechelberg. Both the shuttle bus driver and cable car operator were really grumpy. We tried paying for both the shuttle bus and the cable car ride, but every time we asked someone how or where we pay they just kept sending us to someone else. When we got to the parking garage in Lauterbrunnen, Nicole and I raced each other down the stairwell. When we exited the stairwell, we both tripped on a lip in the doorway, which caused us to burst into laughter. We joked the entire trip about how edges like that one seemed to be all over Switzerland. We drove to Grindelwald, which is kind of a separate canyon from where we had spent the rest of the day. We wanted to quickly see that other side before leaving the region the next morning. We considered eating dinner in Grindelwald, but we ended up going back to Interlaken to eat at a Rick-Steves-recommended restaurant called Goldener Anker. We ordered off their “backpacker special” menu. Nicole ordered the gnocchi and I ordered a rigatoni pasta dish (we shared both). For dessert we tried going to the same chocolate shop we found the night before, but it was closed again. We went back to our hostel and did the same thing we did the night before—we grabbed a blanket and watched videos in the movie room. We watched a Tom Segura special called “Mostly Stories” and laughed like crazy. We also showed each other more of our favorite YouTube videos. When we went to bed, Nicole sent me a “Cat Facts” text message from a number I didn’t recognize, so I didn’t know it was her.

## Thursday, December 8
### Lucerne
We slept in in Interlaken and then left for Lucerne. After we checked into our Lucerne hostel (Backpackers Lucerne Hostel), we took advantage of our roommates’ absence and made out for a while. I was sitting in a chair and Nicole sat in my lap. Afterwards we left to take a walk to go sightseeing. The first part of the walk was a path around Lake Lucerne. around Lake Lucerne and to see all the sights in the city. While walking by the lake, we saw some huge geese. Nicole mentioned how a German friend of hers was told by a girl from Connecticut that the word “goose” was only used in fairy tales, and that they were actually called “big ducks.” We joked about that every time we saw a goose. We walked to and through Lucerne’s main cathedral (Church of St. Leodegar). We then grabbed lunch at Heini Luzern—a panini cafe that was super crowded (that day was a regional holiday—Immaculate Conception Day—so many of the restaurants were closed). We shared two paninis and got two dessert items to go—one slice of chocolate cake and one Vermicelles (a traditional Swiss dessert made from chestnut puree). We walked by a dessert shop and saw macarons in the window. I mentioned how I had never had one before, so we decided to get some. We picked eight different flavors and shared all of them. We walked through the rest of the old part of town, and by the time we came back around to the lake, it was getting dark and the Christmas lights around town had been turned on. There was one building that looked like a Christmas advent calendar. We found a really busy Christmas market in a small square next to a church (the Franziskanerkirche). We ate a traditional Swiss sausage and then noticed that an orchestra of some type was about to perform, so we stayed to watch. It ended up being an entire orchestra of the French trombone. I told Nicole how Jen hates the French trombone and how she would always complain about it, so I saw it as a sign that I was in the right place, at the right time, with the right person. After the orchestra finished their first song, we went inside the Franziskanerkirche. When we entered, it felt like everyone was looking at us. It appeared that they had either just finished a performance or service, or else they were about to start one. A man came up to us and started speaking to us in German. We tried to tell him we couldn’t understand, but he kept talking anyway. Then he said something about “6 o’clock.” We couldn’t tell if he was wanting us to come back at 6:00 or asking us to leave before something started at 6:00...so we left. We stopped at a chocolate shop where we bought a bag of Lindt chocolates. On our way back to our hostel, we stopped at another Christmas market and drank a cup of hot apple cider.

When we got back to our hostel, we grabbed a blanket from our room and sat on the couch in the common room. A lady walked in and gave us a dirty look because she could tell we were being kinda naughty under the blanket, which made us laugh. At some point that evening, I left our room and could see Nicole through a mirror, hiding in a dark corner waiting to scare me. I tried to scare her first, but we ended up just yelling at the same time. We both had to sleep on top bunks in our room since both bottom bunks were taken. It ended up being nice because we could look across the room and see each other. Earlier in the day, I had told Nicole about the Cat Facts text message I received in Interlaken. While we were in bed, I got another text and realized it was her that was sending them to me. Then we texted each other until we fell asleep. 

## Friday, December 9
### Lake Como
We woke up early the next morning to leave for Lake Como. I drove for a short time, then Nicole took over since I was so sleepy. Once we got into Italy, the roads got really narrow and made Nicole nervous. But she didn’t complain or ask me to drive, she just let me rest. While checking into our hostel (Lake Como Youth Hostel La Primula), we were told that it would cost us only €10 more to have our own bedroom and bathroom. I immediately said yes...I wasn’t going to turn that down. After dropping off our bags, we walked to the ferry right by our hostel and took it across the lake to Varenna, where we bought gelato and walked around the town.

<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/kzxb9dwrx3u53tb/2016-12-09%2013.18.49-2.jpg?raw=0" />

<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/cil4co8dpztmtv3/2016-12-10%2012.11.37-2.jpg?raw=0" />

Afterwards we walked up to a small church in Varenna, we noticed a narrow path that led up the hillside. We had planned to go to the top of the hill to see Castello di Vezio anyway, so we figured the path would eventually lead to it, or would at least lead somewhere fun. We had a blast hiking up the hill, and it certainly was an adventure! The path kept getting more and more crowded with branches and bushes. I ended up leading us up a wrong path, so we had to backtrack a bit and then Nicole got us back on the right path. When we got to the top of the hill, we looked all over for a way to the castle—Google Maps was telling us that we were really close. We eventually found it, but we were only able to see it for a few minutes since they were closing the grounds. The view of the lake from the castle grounds was gorgeous. I took a photo of Nicole looking out at the lake. She is a true beauty.

We walked back down to Varenna and ate at a restaurant called Far Out. We shared bruschetta and cheese-filled tortellini. Both were delicious, but the tortellini was out of this world! Then we got on a ferry headed to Bellagio. While we were waiting for and riding on the ferry, I could tell something was on Nicole’s mind. I asked her about it and she expressed that she was worried I might not be ready for a serious relationship. I told her that I understood completely, but then I went off on a random tangent and confused the whole conversation because I misunderstood what she was saying. Despite that, Nicole was very patient with me and I was grateful for her willingness to be vulnerable and express her feelings. Since Bellagio was pretty dead due to it being the off season (and because it was getting cold and dark), we spent only a few minutes there. Then we took the ferry back to Menaggio and our hostel. We ordered pizza from the restaurant in our hostel and watched YouTube videos on a bean bag chair while we waited for our food. We were a bit disappointed by the pizza since it wasn’t the Naples-style pizza I had been raving about. We went to our room for the night and were grateful to have a room to ourselves for the first time since we slept at Nicole’s apartment. We made out and were very intimate with each other...and a bit naughty. I wouldn’t change anything about that night. It was truly perfect!

## Saturday, December 10
### Lake Como
The next morning we slept in up to the minute we had to check out of our hostel—we just wanted to stay in bed as long as possible and kiss and hold each other. After checking out, we drove to three different villas on Lake Como—Villa Carlotta, Villa Balbianello, and Villa La Gaeta. We toured the full interior and part of the grounds of Villa Carlotta. While we were touring the gardens, we were astounded at how big the property was—it seemed to go on forever, just like Chillon Castle and the tower steps in the Bern Cathedral. We then drove to Villa Balbianello. We drove in circles in a tiny area several times—for some reason we just didn’t see the sign pointing up to the villa. We finally parked and took the 10-minute walk along the path to the villa. This villa was situated the best since it was on a small peninsula that jutted out into the lake. We weren’t allowed to go inside most of the villa, but the grounds were gorgeous. I was particularly excited to see this villa since parts of Star Wars and Casino Royale were filmed there. We drove up to Villa La Gaeta but it was closed, but we looked at it through the gate and over the hedges. I was excited to see this one as well since another scene from Casino Royale was filmed there. In between visiting Villa Balbianello and Villa La Gaeta, we stopped to eat lunch. We spent about a half hour trying to find something that was open (that day was also a holiday). We finally found a place and had pizza and pasta. Their pizza wasn’t Naples style either! After stopping by Villa La Gaeta, we started our drive to Milan.

### Milan
We arrived in Milan and checked into Hotel Vittoria, which we reserved through the Hotel Tonight app earlier that day. Everything in the hotel was definitely Europe-sized, especially the bathroom and shower. Aside from that, the hotel was surprisingly nice for the price we paid. Before going out to see the city, we rested in our room for a little while. Nicole had heard from a friend about a place in Italy called Kono Pizza, where they make pizza in a cone (obviously). As we were leaving our hotel room to go sightseeing, we decided to ask the hotel concierge if he knew where it was. I made a bet with Nicole that he was going to have no idea what it was and that he would look at us with a judgmental face. We asked him and he had no idea what we were talking about. He actually said, “You mean pizza slices? That comes in a triangle.” We laughed so much when we came out of our hotel. We then walked to Milan’s Piazza del Duomo. The square was beautifully lit for Christmas and had a huge Christmas tree set up. We spent some time walking around the square and taking photos of the cathedral. We looked up Kono Pizza on my phone and it mentioned that they were opening a location soon in Milan’s Piazzale Cadorna. We decided to walk there to see if they had already opened—we figured the website might be out of date. Unfortunately, it wasn’t there yet. We walked back to the neighborhood where our hotel was so that we could eat at a restaurant recommended by our hotel’s concierge. It was called Il Pomodorino. They had authentic Naples-style pizza (finally), and it was perfect! We both also ordered pasta, which wasn’t as good. During dinner, I laughed and accidentally said, “I love you” to Nicole and then tried to cover it up or explain it away by saying, “you know what I mean” (even though I had already fallen in love with her by that point and hadn’t realized it). We went back to our hotel room for the night and were very intimate with each other again...and a bit naughty as well. It was so amazing to be able to hold each other in bed for one more night.

## Sunday, December 11
### Milan
While we were laying in bed in the morning, Nicole said to me, “Baby, I miss you!” and I responded with, “Awww...wait, what do you mean? I’m right here.” We laughed a ton about that. Also, I felt how cold Nicole’s butt was and I said, “Ohhhh, baaaaaabyyyyy!!!” I loved every minute of watching Nicole get ready in front of the mirror that morning. We checked out of our hotel and left to make the four-hour drive back to Antibes. During the drive, we stopped at a gas station in Italy to get gas and a snack. While we were looking at food, the man working there told us that the focaccia bread was fresh, and he recommended we pick a deli meat after which he would cut the bread, put the meat on, and warm it up for us. We picked salami, and it was so delicious!

### French Riviera (Nice, Antibes, etc.)
When we got back to France, we first we went back to Nicole’s apartment so that I could grab the stuff I had left behind as well as a bag Nicole needed me to take back to the states. We went to a creperie Nicole wanted to take me to called [NAME??]. We shared a crepe with goat cheese and spinach as well as a crepe with Nutella. They were amazing! While walking back to Nicole’s apartment, we stopped at a small market to buy a package of one of her favorite treats—8 mini beignets with a chocolate-hazelnut filling (a brand called Les Délices des 7 Vallées). It was probably the best dessert I have ever had in my life! We also bought Schweppes Agrum—one of Nicole’s favorite drinks—which was also delicious. We drove past the bay by Antibes on our way to Nice. There were sailboats on the water and the sun was setting. We could also see Fort Carré in the distance. We arrived at Nice and walked around. We ate some ice cream and visited a big Christmas carnival.

<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/9kixe71wdy3qhc5/2016-12-11%2017.00.31-2.jpg?raw=0" />

After walking through the carnival and Christmas market, we sat on a cement wall on the beach. I asked Nicole to sit in front of me, between my legs. It was wonderful being able to just sit, hold her, and look out at the water. Then Nicole took me to get socca, which is a French food Nice is known for.

### Nice Côte d'Azur International Airport
We took the rental car back to the airport and then walked into the terminal. Nicole and I checked her bag. Then we sat together for a few minutes, both of us super bummed that I had to leave. We stood up to hug and kiss each other. I looked into Nicole’s eyes and thought I saw tears starting to form, but she didn’t cry. After we parted, she told me that she cried on the bus ride home.

### London
I arrived at Heathrow Airport in London Sunday evening and immediately headed toward the the tube (London Underground). I decided to take advantage of the fact I was in London and walk around the city. It wasn’t until well after 11:00 that I finally got into the city. I walked all over, seeing many of the sights including the Tower of London, the Tower Bridge, London Bridge, St Paul’s Cathedral, and the Strand Palace Hotel (where I stayed with my parents and sister back in 2004). Of course, everything was closed so I only got to see the exterior of everything. Around 3 or 4am I decided to head back to the airport. I didn’t plan ahead, so it was only then that I realized the tube was closed until morning. It took me a while, but I figured out which bus I needed to take to get back to the airport. But then I got off the bus one stop too early (the wrong terminal), and it took forever to get back on the right bus to take me to the terminal I needed to go to. I tried to sleep as much as I could at the airport before my early-afternoon flight to LAX.

### Los Angeles
I arrived at LAX Monday afternoon. I had to go through customs since I was coming back into the country. When it was finally my turn to go up to one of the customs officers, the guy behind the desk took about 10 minutes looking at my passport, looking at me, and looking at his monitor. He finally said, “Have you heard of Baldwin County?” I said, “No, where is that?” He didn’t respond. He turned to his colleague next to him and said, “We’ve got a 1014 here!” The other guy didn’t respond, so the man repeated loudly, “We have a 1014!” At that point, I was asked to put my bag on the desk and place my hands behind my back. They handcuffed me in front of the hundreds of people, telling me it was “for [my] own safety,” and that I had to go with them to a back room to talk with them.

I spent the next 90 minutes detained and in handcuffs! First, the two customs officers that took me to the back room questioned me and went through my bag. One of them took my shoes off, removed the shoelaces, and put my shoes back on. He also took my belt, went through my pockets, and took my wallet and phone. The man going through my bag kept asking me about things in my bag. For example, I had Swiss Franc coins that I was bringing back for Tom and Eli for Christmas. He was super concerned that I had two bags and that both had identical contents. He also saw some rolled up duct tape that I had and questioned me about it. After about 20 minutes of this, they took me into another holding room that had a metal bench. I was standing in the middle of the room and they told me they needed to uncuff me so that they could cuff me to the bench. There were three men around me, and one of them said, “I am going to take these cuffs off now—are we going to have a problem?” They were treating me like I was freaking Jason Bourne! They handcuffed me to the bench and then a third, very-caustic customs officer came in. He explained that there is a state warrant out for my arrest. I explained that that wasn’t possible, that I had never heard of Baldwin County, and that this was the first time in my life I had ever been in handcuffs. They explained that, either it was me, someone stole my identity, or that there really is someone else out there named Joshua David Dean, born on my exact birthdate and that is also 6’2” and 155 pounds. This man explained that since it was a state warrant, I had to talk to the LAPD. He said I had to wait there until the LAPD showed up. I told him I had a flight in a few hours, and he said, “Don’t worry about that flight.” I asked if I could call my parents who were going to be expecting me and he said no.

The three men left the room and I was stuck there alone with my own thoughts. I imagined the absolute worst—that I had committed a crime without realizing it and that I was going to end up in prison and my kids would be fatherless. I also briefly thought that Baldwin County could be near Pittsburgh, and that perhaps someone in Jen’s extended family had turned me in for something I hadn’t done. I prayed and begged the Lord to help me.

I was alone in that cell for about 20 minutes, but it felt like an eternity. Three LAPD officers showed up with one new customs officer (the other three customs officers were nowhere to be seen). They were all a lot more kind. They questioned me for a while, asking me the same types of questions the others had asked me. They finally concluded that I wasn’t the same Joshua David Dean...though, they never told me why they concluded that. They told me that I’d need to clear up whatever the problem was with my local PD because if I ever get pulled over by the cops or go out of the country again, I’ll end up in handcuffs again.
